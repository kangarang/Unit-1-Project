##Yut Nori
Traditionally played on Korean holidays, Yut Nori is a simple board game where the players try to advance to the end of the board. Using a binary dice system, Four sticks are thrown with either 0 or 1 value. The sum of the roll is the total value that the player advances on the board. A total roll of 0 however equals a total value of 5. If a player rolls of 4 (Yut) or a 5 (Mo), they get to roll again (and again, until they roll a number that is not 4 or 5). The sum of the *entire roll sequence* is now the new total roll. If the boardgame pieces (Mal) land on the two special corner spots on the board, they must take the shortcut towards the center of the board. If a Mal happens to land on their opponent's Mal, then the roller "eats" his/her opponent and gets to roll again while the opponent must start from the beginning. Additionally, if the player has at least 1 Mal on the board, they may choose which Mal to move. If a player chooses to stack their Mal together, they may not be "eaten" by opponents unless the opponents themselves have stacked their Mal.
