##Yut Nori
Traditionally played on Korean holidays, Yut Nori is a simple game where the players try to advance to the end of the board. Four sticks are thrown as dice with either 0 or 1 value. The sum of the rolls is the total value that the player advances on the board. A total roll of 0 however equals a total value of 5. If a player rolls of 4 or a 5, they get to roll again (and again, until they don't roll a 4 or a 5). The sum of the *entire roll sequence* is now the new total roll. If the boardgame pieces (Mal) land on the two special corner spots on the board, they must take the shortcut towards the center of the board. If a Mal happens to land on their opponent's Mal, then the former gets to roll again and the latter must start from the beginning. This is where it gets interesting. If the player who is about to move his/her Mal have rolled more than once (after rolling 4 or 5 on their first), they may choose which roll to use first before moving their Mal, giving the player tremendous positional advantage. Additionally, if the player has at least 1 Mal on the board, they may choose which Mal to move (usually there are more than 1 Mal per team). Furthermore, if a player chooses to stack their Mal together, they may not be "eaten" by opponents unless the opponents themselves have stack their Mal.


##Mook Jji Ppa
Rock-Paper-Scissors ends quickly. With Mook Jji Ppa, the game can go on for minutes! The first stage of MJP is the same as RPS. However the first round only determines who the advantage goes to. The second stage of MJP is where the player who has the advantage tries to beat the other player by making him/her display the same hand signal as he/she. The game continues with advantage/disadvantage until there is one winner. To make the game worth playing, rules include - if you're at the disadvantage, you cannot change your hand signal before the player with the advantage does. Players must attempt to change hand signals as soon as the advantage player changes his/hers - they must not take longer than a reasonable time (~0.1sec) to change hand signals.




##Issues
I was only able to get each game partially working to their full potential.

- I will continue to develop Yut Nori until it is complete with all rules in place.
  - Did not program more than 2 Mal total (usually there are 3 per team and over 2 teams)
  - Did not program for sum of roll sequence or additional rolls after eating opponents
  - Did not program for stacking Mal

Coding for hours upon hours was not ideal. I found my creativity low after a few hours.
No matter how much I planned my code in advance, it wasn't enough planning.
Certain things seemed a lot easier until I got down to the actual hard code.
I was stuck on DOM manipulation for hours, and it wasn't until I was on the train home that I had an instant where I said "AH-HA!" and figured out the answer, and then I realized I missed my stop. It was only after hours of frustration that I finally took a break which interestingly enough led me to the epiphany.

In the end, I am so happy because I learned so much from this week's project.
I very much look forward to what's to come from this course.
